Goal:
Build a JavaScript/TypeScript library called vibe-sandbox that generates aesthetic UI elements, animations, and style presets based on simple “vibe” configurations. This should be a standalone API/library — not a full app — with clear, reusable functions.

Core Requirements

Project Setup

Use TypeScript.

Output should include both ESM + CJS builds.

Provide proper package.json, tsconfig.json, and a clean folder structure (src/, dist/).

No UI framework dependencies — keep it framework-agnostic (React demo can come later).

Main Features
Implement a core function:

createVibe(config: VibeConfig): VibeTheme


where:

VibeConfig includes:

preset?: string (e.g., "cosmic", "soft-neon", "retro-terminal")

intensity?: number

animation?: boolean

VibeTheme returns:

colors (palette for bg, text, accent)

gradients

shadows

motion (duration, easing, spring values)

particles config (optional)

css — prebuilt CSS variables for easy drop-in use

Preset System
Add at least three presets:

cosmic → deep blues, purples, star/particle settings, soft glow

soft-neon → neon accents, dark base, slight pulsing animations

retro-terminal → green/amber monochrome palette, scanline effect configs

Each preset should be modular and extendable:

const presets = {
  cosmic: {...},
  softNeon: {...},
  retroTerminal: {...}
}


Animation Utilities
Include a small animation utility section:

easing functions

CSS keyframe string generators

helper motionStyle(vibeTheme) that outputs a bundled style object

Output Format
The API should allow two main usage styles:

A. JS/TS object use

const vibe = createVibe({ preset: "cosmic" });
element.style.background = vibe.gradients.primary;


B. Auto-generated CSS variables

const cssVars = vibe.toCSS();
// inject into <style> or export


Extensibility
Make the architecture plugin-friendly:

registerPreset(name: string, data: VibePreset): void
registerEffect(name: string, generator: Function): void


Testing
Add minimal tests for:

preset loading

theme generation

CSS variable output

Documentation Stubs
Add placeholder Markdown files:

/docs/overview.md

/docs/api.md
(Just stubs — I’ll fill these in later.)

Deliverables

Working TypeScript library with build scripts

createVibe() with full preset system

Animation + CSS utilities

3 complete presets

Plugin system

Minimal tests

Docs stubs

Exported type definitions

Extra Notes

Keep the code clean and modular.

Avoid anything frontend/framework-specific.

The goal is an API that can be consumed by React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla HTML/CSS.

No demo website needed — just the library.
